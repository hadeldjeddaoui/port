<h2>what does the web developer do ?</h2>

<h4>web developers design and build websites. They are typically responsible for the appearance of the site and technical aspects, such as site speed and how much traffic the site can handle. Web developers may also create site content that requires technical features.
    They are sometimes known as web designers or full-stack developers if they can do both front-end and back-end development.

<h2>are websites important?</h2>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h4>in whatever business or job you are working on, website helps create brand awareness and showcasing your brand to prospective customers. It helps to establish your image by letting the audience know who you are and what you represent. A website provides reliable information to the consumers, which helps in setting your business apart from the competitors.With 93% of business decisions starting with a search engine search that means if you don't have a website, you are only selling to 7% of your market. That is right, you are reducing the potential size of your business by 93%. I would suggest that the same statistic for consumer purchases is lower but still very high, especially for larger ticket items. The larger the item, the more research and shopping people will do. My guess is probably 40-50% of consumer purchases start with an online search. Have a website that will be search engine optimized and designed to drive sales.
    Another reason why a website is important for your business is that there is a large portion of the market that won't even consider you as an option when they are looking to buy, if you don't have one.  I know personally if I am dealing with a supplier I am looking to purchase from and they don't even have a website I pretty much write them off as an option and my view of that company is diminished. It gives me the impression that it is a company that is very poorly managed.</h4>
